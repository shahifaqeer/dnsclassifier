DNS Classifier

dns_response_parser:
- Parses a DNS response packet to create ARECORD and CNAME tables
- Requires domain:application mapping file

ip_to_application_mapping:
- For any input IP address, spits out domain name and application

DNSClassify (or DNSSpy) module should import Mapper class and define
a search function which initializes Mapper() and calls
Mapper.searchType('domain_name_for_which_type_is_needed')

This will return a Service Type which is:
- VIDEO
- ADVERT
- WEB
- BACKGROUND
- DEFAULT

These types are saved in servicedef/*.ini as regex strings.

To test Mapper module for some realistic dns responses, run python run_test.py
